# SQRT
An algorithm to extract a square root from any positive number.

This is an algorithm that I made based on a number of simple mathematical equations.

On large numbers (over a million) the proximity must be increased, but for other numbers it seems
to work perfectly well.

The test sequence of double[] numberToTest = {57, 111, 89, 1111, 5531, 5, 2, 3, 11, 13, 17, 117, 272727}
returns:
result 7.549834
result 10.535653
result 9.433981
result 33.331666
result 74.370693
